Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe Earth and its solar system.

# first installation notes:
Need to update anaconda, python to python3.7, install opencv, requests, and also the binaries under the YOLO folder.  Had to also update the .cfg file to hadle my requirements, not the generic.

Performed the installation and it appears to be working.

Now starting to do some analysis of the results using pandas and a jupyter
notebook.


Debugging a few new ideas/approaches.

Added in a convertor to change the existing csv data to an sqlite db.
